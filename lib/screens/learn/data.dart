      "Epilepsy/Seizures",
      "Epilepsy is a chronic condition, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. It has several causes; it may be genetic or may occur in people who have a past history of birth trauma, brain infections or head injury. In some cases, no specific cause can be identified. Seizures are caused by abnormal discharges in the brain and can be of different forms; people with epilepsy can have more than one type of seizure. The two major forms of seizures are convulsive and non-convulsive. Non-convulsive epilepsy has features such as change in awareness, behaviour, emotions or senses (such as taste, smell, vision or hearing) similar to mental health conditions, so may be confused with them. Convulsive epilepsy has features such as sudden muscle contraction, causing the person to fall and lie rigidly, followed by the muscles alternating between relaxation and rigidity, with or without loss of bowel or bladder control. This type is associated with greater stigma and higher morbidity and mortality.",

The child or adolescent shifts frequently from one activity to another. These deficits in persistence and attention should be diagnosed as a disorder only if they are excessive for the child or adolescent's age and intelligence, and affect their normal functioning and learning. Overactivity implies excessive restlessness, especially in situations requiring relative calm. It may involve the child or adolescent running and jumping around, getting up from a seat when he or she was supposed to remain seated, excessive talkativeness and noisiness, or fidgeting and wriggling. The characteristic behavioural problems should be of early onset (before age 6 years) and long duration (> 6 months), and not limited to only one setting.",

The use of the term 'intellectual disability' in this Declaration includes children with autism who have intellectual impairments. For the purposes of this Declaration, the term also encompasses children who have been institutionalized because of a perceived disability or family rejection and who acquire developmental delays and psychological problems as a result of their institutionalization.",

They are, however, recognized as his or her own thoughts, even though they are involuntary and often repugnant. Compulsive acts or rituals are stereotyped behaviours that are repeated again and again. They are not inherently enjoyable, nor do they result in the completion of inherently useful tasks. Their function is to prevent some objectively unlikely event, often involving harm to or caused by the patient, which he or she fears might otherwise occur. Usually, this behaviour is recognized by the patient as pointless or ineffectual and repeated attempts are made to resist. Anxiety is almost invariably present. If compulsive acts are resisted the anxiety gets worse.",

Examples of the behaviours may include: excessive levels of fighting or bullying; cruelty to animals or other people; fire- setting; severe destructiveness to property; stealing; repeated lying and running away from school or home.

Predisposing factors, such as personality traits (e.g. compulsive, asthenic) or previous history of neurotic illness, may lower the threshold for the development of the syndrome or aggravate its course, but they are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain its occurrence. Typical features include episodes of repeated reliving of the trauma in intrusive memories (flashbacks), dreams or nightmares, occurring against the persisting background of a sense of numbness and emotional blunting, detachment from other people, unresponsiveness to surroundings, anhedonia, and avoidance of activities and situations reminiscent of the trauma. There is usually a state of autonomic hyperarousal with hypervigilance, an enhanced startle reaction, and insomnia. Anxiety and depression are commonly associated with the above symptoms and signs, and suicidal ideation is not infrequent. The onset follows the trauma with a latency period that may range from a few weeks to months. The course is fluctuating but recovery can be expected in the majority of cases. In a small proportion of cases the condition may follow a chronic course over many years, with eventual transition to an enduring personality change.",
